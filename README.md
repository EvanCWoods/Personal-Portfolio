## Description
This is my personal portfolio website which demonstrates my work as it relates to writing code and writing technical articles. The portfolio itself if written using React, Node, Express, Material UI, and Cosmos Db, with hosting being handled by Microsoft Azure.

Not only does this allow a user to experience my projects, but also my interest through technical writing on the blog section, and what I am learning currently.


## Questions
For any questions about the code please see my github for source code, email me at the address provided, or find my social media links on my portfolio website.
